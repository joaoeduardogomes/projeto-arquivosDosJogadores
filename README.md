# Projeto: Aqruivos dos Jogadores
This project was created to keep the profiles of a few Among Us players from the group I'm in. The design was made to resemble files stored in an office, adding a comedy touch to the presentation.

## What problem does it solve?
It was quite challenging to distinguish the players from each other, especially since not everyone knew each other well. To address this issue, I developed this project to provide a centralized platform where all players' data are accessible to every member of the group, ensuring that people wouldn't confuse one member with another.

## Project Goal
The goal was to create a page where all the players' data were readily available and easily accessible to every member of the group, enhancing communication during Among Us games.
